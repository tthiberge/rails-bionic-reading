### Bionic-Reading inspiration

In March 2023, I came across this website that inspired me a lot :https://app.bionic-reading.com/

In order to improve my tech skills, I decided to try to reproduce their app behavior, on a much lower level.

I've followed two roads:
- One with Ruby on Rails, that hasn't been successful so far,
- One with javascript that can reproduce the basic behavior of the bionic-reading: highlighting in bold the first half of each word

I'm trying to use some nice front to support the backend

If you want to give me some feedback or advice, feel free to reach out!
